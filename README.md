# mx-unit-networking

This repository contains networking hacks to make the devnet-wallet, devnet-explorer and xPortal app use our localnet insted of the real network.

# Reverse proxy

We use `caddy` as a reverse proxy. It does HTTP Host based routing and SSL termination. Make sure to add the root CA generated by `caddy` to the trusted roots in your OS.

# DNS

Manually add the follwing records in your local DNS server (replace `127.0.0.1` with the IP address of the machine where `caddy` is running):

```
127.0.0.1 devnet-gateway.multiversx.com
127.0.0.1 devnet-socket-fra.multiversx.com
127.0.0.1 devnet-socket-fra.elrond.com
127.0.0.1 devnet-api.multiversx.com
127.0.0.1 devnet-delegation-api.multiversx.com
```
